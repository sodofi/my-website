# Reads & Listens

A collection of things I'm reading and listening to.

## Reading...

**[How the World Really Works](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/666342/how-the-world-really-works-by-vaclav-smil/) by Vaclav Smil**

Explains how energy (particularly from fossil fuels) shapes human societies. This book has strongly framed my understanding of the world.

**[Read Write Own](https://readwriteown.com/) by Chris Dixon**

Explores how blockchains are building the next era of the internet. Anytime someone asks me why I work in crypto, I tell them to read this book. 

## Listening To...

**[The Gray Area](https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area) with Sean Illing**

A philosophy-minded look at culture, technology, politics, and the world of ideas. Always teaches me a new perspective and encourages me to think critically about the world around me.

**[Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/podcast) by Lenny Rachitsky**

A series of interviews with top product leaders and growth experts. Love its practical advice on building, launching, and scaling successful products.
