# My Everything Bio


Hi, I'm Sophia. 

Over the years, I've tried several mediums to capture 'who I am.' From a design portfolio, to a blog, to open source project repositories, etc. etc. but in each of them, I was writing for a different audience and hiding an aspect of myself. So that's why I'm creating an everything site -- one that encapsulates my goals, my history, projects, writings, learnings, and just everything about me that I want to share with the world.

## My North Star

**My north star is technological progress that supports collective flourishing for people and the planet.**

I believe people have an amazing ability to innovate.

I believe technology can push humanity forward at unprecedented speeds.

I believe the planet's health is a good indicator to check if we're moving in the right direction.

## Who Am I?

### **I'm a builder.**

I love tinkering with cutting edge tech and building things. I'm mostly fascinated with the intersection of blockchain technology and human flourishing. That's a lot of jargon for essentially saying I'm a technical optimist and I believe we can use permissionless technologies (aka blockchains) to build incredible things for the world. 

### **I'm a product designer.**

The core of every good product is solving a problem for a real human. In college, I studied computer science, to teach me the tools to build things, and product design, to teach me the framework for understanding *why* we're even building the thing in the first place. I practice design thinking principles in all that I do, which is an iterative process for ensuring the people you're building for are actively involved in the creation of what is being built. 

### **I'm an entrepreneur.**

A few of the things I started:

- Flamingle, a professional video networking app aquired by StartupTree. Recognizing that most job opportunities come from the hidden job market (aka from your network instead of job postings) we set out to create a way for students to easily network with professionals via TikTok style video chats.

- Friends & Family Founders, a non-profit to support students at Stanford to build. The idea was simple - encourage students to work on building something non-school related. In return, builders get access to microgrants, industry connections, demo days, and more.

- DewItLabs, a web3 product design consulting agency. I worked with several blockchain companies and DAOs to support onchain funding mechanisms. I prototyped novel ways of allocating capital in a more transparent, trustless, and democratic way.

### **I'm a developer advocate.**

I support a global community of developers building on Celo. Celo is a blockchain focused on mobile, stablecoins, and users in growing markets. My role at Celo lets me work with builders around the world to make real world blockchain adoption a reality. Building something cool? DM me!

### **I'm a content creator.**

I create sketchnotes that showcase how cutting edge tech can be used to solve humanities biggest problems. Typically, I share about onchain product ideas that I would love to see in the world. My hope is that this content can inspire people to shape the future of technology in a positive direction. 

### **I'm a community gatherer.**

Maybe its the fact that I grew up in a Mexican-Chinese household, but I was taught that bringing people together is the biggest gift a person can do. Lately, I've been organizing networking events for builders in SF and NYC. Sign up here if you want to come to the next one!

### **I'm a culture lover.**

There's nothing I love more than being immerssed in new cultues. I'm very grateful that I've had the opportunity to live all around the world. From learning Zulu in South Africa to celebrating my birthday with my host family in Ecuador, there is so much we can learn about our collective humanity through cultural immersion.
