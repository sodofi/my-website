# Life Philosophy

Fun Fact: The name Sophia means wisdom in Greek. Growing up in a Mexican-Chinese household, I was disapointed my name was too ethnically ambigious. I didn't have a Spansih or Chinese meaning and as a kid, I felt that *wisdom* was boring. As I've gotten older, I've learned to deeply appreciate my name as a representation of knowledge for all that came before me and all that will come after me.

On that note, here are some of my guiding beliefs and values.

**1. Be yourself so that people who are looking for you, can find you.**

The reason that I share so much about my life publically is in the hopes that my beliefs and values resonate with someone. *If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.* I want to go far. 

**2. If you can find a strong enough why, you will find a strong enough how.**

Every year, I relect on my IKIGAI - a Japanese concept that refers to a reason for living, or a sense of purpose. Having a strong understanding of the *why* makes the *how* that much more attainable.

**3. Lead with hope and optimism.**

The future is scary. Technology is moving fast, our planet is increasingly warming, and it can feel like humans are in constant conflict with one another. It's easy to be cynical. It's hard to be optimistic. *Do things that are hard.*

**4. Stay curious.**

The world is complicated and we will never fully understand it all. So stay curious and recognize that the world does not need to fit in our own conceptual box. Be open to new ideas that contrast our own and stay humble in our knowledge.
